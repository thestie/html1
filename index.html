        <h1>Hello, English 388</h1>
        <p>My name is Brendyn Chao, I am a Taiwanese American from California who came to Seattle to study physiology at the University
            of Washington. I was born in Mountain View, California and moved to Taiwan for five years during elementary school. My interests
            are in audio equipment and music, tea, and video games. Specifically, I am interested in headphones, black and oolong teas from Taiwan,
            and playing role-playing games such as Final Fantasy or Crosscode. For exercise, I strongly dislike running, but it is the only form of exercise I tolerate, having done it for 
            four years during high school cross country.
