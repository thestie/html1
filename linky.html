    <p>My favorite band is poison girlfriend. Despite listening to only one album of their music, I can wholeheartedly endorse their songs
      such as their hit song: hardly ever smile without you from their album melting moment. Below is a link that directs to their wikipedia page.

    <p>This wikipedia page talks about my favorite band: poison girlfriend, and how it is now known as nOrikO as well as how the band originally got its name
      from another album: "poison boyfriend" by Momas. It also talks about how poison girlfriend is known as poison girl friend in promotional material
      and albums. The wikipedia article also includes their albums and release dates, as well as their signings and work.
